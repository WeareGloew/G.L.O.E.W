      <h1>About G.L.O.E.W</h1>
      <p>
        G.L.O.E.W is a trauma-informed sisterhood space for young women
        who are ready to heal, grow, and step into the soft, stable lives they deserve.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- WHY WE EXIST -->
    <section class="section-narrow animate">
      <div class="section-pill">Our heart</div>
      <h2 class="section-title">Why G.L.O.E.W exists</h2>

      <p class="section-lead">
        G.L.O.E.W was created from lived experience — as a response to the gaps so many young women
        fall through when it comes to healing, safety, confidence, and real-life opportunities.
      </p>

      <div class="section-grid" style="margin-top: 18px;">
        <div class="card-soft">
          <span class="pill-mini">For the girl who…</span>
          <h3>Has survived more than she’s ever said out loud.</h3>
          <p>
            We hold space for young women who may have experienced domestic abuse, sexual violence,
            emotional harm, unstable relationships, or childhood trauma — and who are ready to
            move from surviving to slowly, gently thriving.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card-soft">
          <span class="pill-mini">We believe…</span>
          <h3>You shouldn’t have to heal alone.</h3>
          <p>
            Healing is hard, especially in isolation. G.L.O.E.W is built as a sisterhood:
            a community where women can breathe, unpack, laugh, cry, and rebuild together —
            supported by trauma-informed practice, lived experience, and practical tools.

      <div class="section-grid">
        <div class="card-soft">
          <span class="pill-mini">Safety</span>
          <h3>Emotional + physical safety first.</h3>
          <p>
            We prioritise consent, confidentiality, boundaries and emotional check-ins.
            No one is pushed to share more than they want to.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card-soft">
          <span class="pill-mini">Dignity</span>
          <h3>You are more than what happened to you.</h3>
          <p>
            We see every woman as whole — not broken. We focus on strengths, resilience,
            gifts and the future, not just on the pain.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card-soft">
          <span class="pill-mini">Sisterhood</span>
          <h3>No one left behind.</h3>
          <p>
            G.L.O.E.W builds real, honest connections. Women celebrate each other,
            challenge harmful patterns, and hold each other accountable with love.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card-soft">
          <span class="pill-mini">Growth</span>
          <h3>Small steps count.</h3>
          <p>
            We celebrate every win: a boundary, a red flag noticed, a CV updated,
            a poem performed. Growth is emotional and practical.
